EXPLANATION = """\
This script will create a new XBlock project.

You will be prompted for two pieces of information:

* Short name: a single word, all lower-case, for directory and file names.
  For a hologram 3-D XBlock, you might choose "holo3d".

* Class name: a valid Python class name.  It's best if this ends with "XBlock",
  so for our hologram XBlock, you might choose "Hologram3dXBlock".

Once you specify those two words, a directory will be created in the current
directory containing the new project.

If you don't want to create the project here, or you enter a name incorrectly,
just type Ctrl-C to stop this script.  If you don't want the resulting project,
just delete the directory it created.
