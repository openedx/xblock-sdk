"""
XBlock persistent state storage.

We use a Django model to store state in all our various scopes in one table. We
make no effort to be smart about batch updates, so performance isn't great. We
mostly use Django because we already have it as a dependency and because Django
Admin gives us a lot of basic search/filtering for free.
